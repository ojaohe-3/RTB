### Git structure
All code written to git should only be posted to dev01. Any new feature make a relavent branch for that implementation. Test conducted will be performed on Branch comp01. Buggs addressed must also be done on its own branch as if a feature. Do not user merge between feature branches, if an feature needs an other, then merge them on a intermediate branch before merging it to dev01
